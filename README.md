# OPS-SAT SDR

## Repository Overview

This repository contains the source code and associated documentation for the Masterâ€™s Thesis: "Software Defined Radio Data Processing on Board OPS-SAT Space Laboratory". The code in this repository is designed to demonstrate a comprehensive software experiment utilizing the OPS-SAT satellite's Software Defined Radio (SDR) subsystem. It provides the implementations needed for in-orbit data acquisition, storage, and processing of radio signals using the Satellite Experimental Processing Platform (SEPP) and demonstrates the complete operational cycle from data capture to downlink.
